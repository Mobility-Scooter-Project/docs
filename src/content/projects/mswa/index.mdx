# Mobility Scooter Web App
The Mobility Scooter Web App (MSWA) is an open source clinical web app funded by the National Science Foundation (NFS).
Its purpose is to enable physical therapists, their students and researchers to upload and analyze videos of patients
using mobility scooters. Over the years, we have fine-tuned machine learning models to identify the pose and task of
a given patient for a given frame or segment of frames.
